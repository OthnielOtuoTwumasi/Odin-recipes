    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kelewele is essentially just fried plantains that have been seasoned with a variety of spices and served alongside roasted groundnuts or even just on their own.</p>
        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ripe Plantains</li>
            <li>1/2 piece Raw Ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 White Onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves Garlic</li>
            <li>1 tsp Nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 tsp Cayenne Pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp Anise Seed</li>
            <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>Oil for frying</li>
    
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a sharp knife, cut a shallow line down the length of the plantain and peel back the skin.</li>
            <li>Chop the plantain into small cubes of about 1 inch size.</li>
            <li>Grate the ginger into a large bowl then add in chopped garlic and chopped onions.</li>
            <li>Now in the bowl blend in your cayenne pepper, anise seed, nutmeg and salt. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Next add in your plantain cubes and toss to coat in the spice mix. Leave to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a deep skillet, add enough oil to slightly submerge the plantains and heat to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Separate the plantain into batches so that each lot can fry without touching one another. This is crucial to achieving the right texture.</li>
            <li>Now for each batch, add into the skillet to brown, turning once during the process. It should take about 5 minutes per batch. </li>
            <li>Use a strainer ladle to remove the plantains from the pan and rest on a plate covered with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Lightly dab the plantains with paper towels to soak up any excess oil and serve immediately.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            
        </ol>
